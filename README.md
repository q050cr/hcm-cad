The concomitant prevalence, natural history and clinical significance of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) has not been sufficiently clarified. Symptomatic HCM patients commonly present with chest pain of diverse etiology, 
including CAD. Clinical physicians identify more patients with HCM at early stages of the disease because of the increased disease awareness 
and the wide availability of cardiac imaging. This subsequently increases the challenges regarding the differentiation of the etiology of 
the patientsâ€™ symptoms. In this study, we analyzed primary HCM patients that underwent coronary angiography and compared them to an age and 
sex-matched patient population that were scheduled for elective coronary angiography (stable chest pain und unclear reduced ejection fraction) 
excluding patients with acute coronary syndrome and previously diagnosed coronary artery disease.
